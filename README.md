Using the water shader, the ocean simulation is played in real time, featured with caustics effect. By clicking on the ocean, ripples can be observe. We also implemented the rotation of the sun and moon, which affects the environment lighting.

## Workload Distribution

##### Noya: 

- Gerstner wave function

- Circle wave function

- Sun & moon rotation

- Perlin noise for sand

- Correct shadow under transparent surface




##### Tsingtao: 

- Read Noyaâ€™s code

- Caustic Effect

- Click interaction

- Circle wave function

- Ripple spread & fade out

- Failed attempt on ray tracing a ton triangles in each shader
